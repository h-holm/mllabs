Assignment 0:

  Each one of the datasets has properties which makes them hard to learn.
  Motivate which of the three problems is most difficult for a decision tree algorithm
  to learn.


  There are three MONK's problems.  The domains for all MONK's problems
  are the same (described below).  One of the MONK's problems has noise
  added. For each problem, the domain has been partitioned into a train
  and test set.
  
  5. Number of Instances: 432

  6. Number of Attributes: 8 (including class attribute)

  7. Attribute information:
      1. class: 0, 1
      2. a1:    1, 2, 3
      3. a2:    1, 2, 3
      4. a3:    1, 2
      5. a4:    1, 2, 3
      6. a5:    1, 2, 3, 4
      7. a6:    1, 2
      8. Id:    (A unique symbol for each instance)

  8. Missing Attribute Values: None

  9. Target Concepts associated to the MONK's problem:

     MONK-1: (a1 = a2) or (a5 = 1)

     MONK-2: EXACTLY TWO of {a1 = 1, a2 = 1, a3 = 1, a4 = 1, a5 = 1, a6 = 1}

     MONK-3: (a5 = 3 and a4 = 1) or (a5 /= 4 and a2 /= 3)
             (5% class noise added to the training set)
